# Cauldron: A digital pantry system

**Cauldron** is a mobile application prototype that tackles the everyday problem of household food waste. By bridging the gap between raw "builder" instincts and structured Information Systems design, this project provides a professional, user-centric solution for kitchen management. 

Users can effortlessly track their food inventory, monitor approaching expiry dates, and receive AI-powered recipe recommendations based on what's currently available in their kitchen. To remove the friction of manual data entry, the app utilizes image recognition to automatically log items straight from grocery receipts.

## Key Features

* **Receipt Scanning (Image Recognition):** Add groceries to your inventory by taking a photo of your receipt. 
* **Inventory Tracking:** Keep a real-time log of what's in your kitchen, categorized for easy browsing.
* **Expiry Date Monitoring:** Get automated alerts before food goes bad, directly contributing to reducing household food waste.
